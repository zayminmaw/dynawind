# dynawind

**dynawind** is a dynamic, flexible theme system for Tailwind CSS that leverages the power of **CSS variables** to enable real-time, user-specific theming. Built with modern frontend needs in mind, it supports both **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **API-based theming**, making it ideal for apps that need theme personalization at scale.

## Why dynawind?

- 🔧 **Dynamic**: Update themes on the fly — no rebuilds needed.
- 🌐 **SSR-Ready**: Seamlessly integrate with server-rendered frameworks like Next.js.
- ⚙️ **API-Based**: Fetch and apply user themes dynamically from an external source.
- 🎨 **Tailwind-Friendly**: Designed to fit perfectly with Tailwind’s utility-first workflow.
- 💡 **Flexible**: Supports light/dark modes, custom palettes, user-defined schemes, and more.

## Use Cases
