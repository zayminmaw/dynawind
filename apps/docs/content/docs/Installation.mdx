import { DynamicCodeBlock } from "fumadocs-ui/components/dynamic-codeblock";

## Install package

Install dynawind into your project via command line.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code="npm i dynawind" />

While dynawind core utilities can work without Tailwind CSS, the package is designed to integrate seamlessly with Tailwindâ€™s ecosystem. For future full theming and styling support, make sure Tailwind CSS is installed in your project.

To ensure compatibility, Dynawind requires Tailwind CSS version 4.0.0 or higher.
