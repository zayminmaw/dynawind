# dynawind-react

Dynawind React wraps the [Dynawind core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynawind) into an easy-to-use React integration, enabling dynamic, flexible Tailwind CSS theming with the power of CSS variables. It supports server-side rendering (SSR) and API-based theming out of the box, making it simple to build adaptive, user-specific themes that update instantly across your React apps.

Although please note this is a **proof of concept**.
