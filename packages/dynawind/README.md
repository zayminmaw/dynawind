# dynawind

Dynawind is a dynamic, flexible theme system for Tailwind CSS that leverages the power of CSS variables. With full support for server-side rendering (SSR) and API-based theming, Dynawind allows you to create adaptable, user-specific themes that update on the fly.

Although please note this is a **proof of concept**.
